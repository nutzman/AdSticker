## Ad Sticker

Online ads are targeted to YOU and are tracking YOU. Why not stick it to the ad networks 
by clicking on everything?

Ad Sticker.

This extension finds all of the ads on your current web page and clicks on them, opening them in a 
new tab. Once the tab has finished loading, the tab closes automatically.

### Why?

You are already being tracked as you browse the web, even if you don't agree
to such practices. Why not add some of your own random data to the mix?

### Bandwith

Since this extension clicks on each advertisement on a web page, you will likely
use more bandwith as you browse. You must click the "Ad Sticker" button to open
all advertisements however. It will never run automatically.

### Ad Blockers

You can't use adblockers and Ad Sticker at the same time. The ads must fully display on your screen
for Ad Sticker to detect and click on them.

### Flash Ads

Ad Sticker can't click on Flash based ads. Disable Flash and most ad networks will deliver a
static image instead.
